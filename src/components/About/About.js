  What is the importance of books in our life?</span> <br></br>Books play a quintessential role in every studentâ€™s life by introducing them to a world of imagination,<br></br> providing knowledge of the outside world, improving their reading, writing and speaking skills <br></br> as well as boosting memory and intelligence. The importance of books in our life cannot be undermined<br></br> for they not only help in broadening our horizons but also act as doorways of connecting us with the world around us.</p>
